### Members

- EAR Sandrine

## Objective 
The objective is to create a basic web application that integrates different concepts that were taught during the PC3R's course curriculum, namely :
- HTTP protocole
- ***REST*** API
- Web servers and servlets
- Data persistence
- Javascript and JS Client libraries (React.js & React Bootstrap)
- AJAX calls and Promise handling

Therefore this application is built-upon technologies that implement these concepts, namely : 
- Apache Tomcat Backend using Java
- Component-oriented architecture using React and React Bootstrap (Javascript)
- Application state management using Redux Toolkit
- AJAX calls using the axios library
- The use of a NoSQL database for data persistence (MongoDB)

## Functionalities
- Simple ***unsecure*** authentication system handled by Redux that includes registering, logging in, and logging out.
- Playing a scored 10-quiz game
- Leaderboard
